## Focus Areas

Today's development focused on implementing and refining the example web app and improving the KoiKoi game module. The main goals were to create a functional web interface and ensure proper game state management.

### Example Web App Implementation

1. **UI Components**

   - Created responsive layout using TailwindCSS
   - Implemented game board with player hands, field, and captured cards sections
   - Added game controls (New Game, Save, Load)
   - Displayed game state information (current player, phase, month, weather)

2. **Card Interaction**

   - Implemented card selection/deselection for both hand and field cards
   - Added visual feedback for selected cards (blue ring for hand, green ring for field)
   - Created dynamic play button that updates based on game phase

3. **Game Flow**
   - Added proper handling of all game phases
   - Implemented result handling for various game actions
   - Added alerts and confirmations for important game events
   - Created Koi-Koi decision dialog

### KoiKoi Module Improvements

1. **Card Selection Logic**

   - Fixed deselection handling in `_handleHandCardSelection`
   - Added proper phase transitions during card selection
   - Implemented validation for card matches
   - Added support for NO_MATCHES_DISCARD phase

2. **Game State Management**

   - Improved phase handling and transitions
   - Added mandatory matching for drawn cards
   - Enhanced result types and data structures
   - Fixed field card selection/deselection logic

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed hand card deselection in field selection phase
   - Corrected match validation logic
   - Fixed phase transitions after card placement
   - Improved error handling and messages

## Technical Details

### Key Changes

```javascript
// Example of improved hand card selection logic
_handleHandCardSelection(cardIndex) {
  if (this.selectedHandCard === cardIndex) {
    // Handle deselection
    this.selectedHandCard = null
    this.selectedFieldCards.clear()
    this.phase = "WAITING_FOR_HAND_CARD"
    return {
      type: "SELECTION_UPDATED",
      data: { ... }
    }
  }
  // ... handle new selection
}
```

### State Management

The game now properly handles these phases:

- WAITING_FOR_HAND_CARD
- WAITING_FOR_FIELD_CARDS
- WAITING_FOR_DECK_MATCH
- NO_MATCHES_DISCARD
- WAITING_FOR_KOI_DECISION
- ROUND_END

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Card Deselection**

   - Challenge: Inconsistent behavior when deselecting cards
   - Solution: Implemented proper phase-aware deselection logic in KoiKoi class

2. **Phase Management**

   - Challenge: Complex state transitions between phases
   - Solution: Centralized phase management in KoiKoi class with clear transitions

3. **UI Feedback**
   - Challenge: Unclear game state for players
   - Solution: Added visual feedback and clear messaging for all game actions

## Next Steps

1. **Enhancements**

   - Add card images and improved visual design
   - Implement animations for card movements
   - Add sound effects for card interactions

2. **Features**

   - Implement proper game state loading
   - Add multiplayer support
   - Create tutorial mode

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement undo/redo functionality
   - Add game state persistence
