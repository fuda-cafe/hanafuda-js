# Hanafuda Library Development Log

## Core Implementation

### December 6, 2023

### Cards Module (`src/core/cards.js`)

- ✅ Implemented card type definitions (CardType, FlowerType)
- ✅ Created comprehensive card data structure (48 cards)
- ✅ Added card lookup and filtering functions
- ✅ Added index validation functionality
- ✅ Added helper functions for finding cards by type/month

### Collection Module (`src/core/collection.js`)

- ✅ Implemented Set-based collection data structure
- ✅ Added card management operations (add, remove, has)
- ✅ Added bulk operations (addMany, removeMany)
- ✅ Added filtering capabilities (findByType, findByMonth)
- ✅ Made collection iterable using Symbol.iterator
- ✅ Added strict validation for card indices

### Deck Module (`src/core/deck.js`)

- ✅ Implemented deck creation and management
- ✅ Added Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- ✅ Added draw operations (single and multiple)
- ✅ Ensured immutability of deck state

### Matching Module (`src/core/matching.js`)

- ✅ Implemented card matching logic
- ✅ Added card comparison functionality
- ✅ Added utility function for finding matches in collections

## Testing

- ✅ Card definitions and operations
- ✅ Collection operations and validation
- ✅ Deck operations and shuffling
- ✅ Card matching functionality

## Design Decisions

- Using indices instead of objects for memory efficiency
- Strict validation on collection modification
- Immutable interfaces for deck and collection
- Separation of matching logic from collection implementation
- Iterables for collection interface

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement scoring/yaku system
- [ ] Add game state management
- [ ] Implement rule variations
- [ ] Add serialization support

## Future Considerations

- Performance optimization for larger games
- Additional game variants
- State persistence
- Network play support

## Day 3: Core Module Completion & Scoring Module Planning

### Completed

- Finished implementing and testing the matching module
- Created comprehensive documentation for the core module in `src/core/README.md`
- Core module is now feature complete with cards, deck, collection, and matching utilities

### Scoring Module Planning

Key considerations for tomorrow's implementation:

1. **Yaku Structure**

   - How to represent yaku definitions (card combinations that score points)
   - Separation of base rules from game-specific variations
   - Handling yaku upgrades (e.g., 5 Bright cards upgrading from 4 Bright cards)

2. **Scoring Logic**

   - Strategy for calculating all possible yaku vs highest scoring combinations
   - Handling mutually exclusive yaku
   - Potential caching of intermediate results
   - Managing cards that contribute to multiple yaku

3. **Performance Considerations**

   - Efficient yaku checking algorithms
   - Possibility of pre-calculating potential matches
   - Consideration of bitwise operations for set operations

4. **API Design**

   - Structure for both scoring calculation and yaku checking
   - Helper functions for common yaku patterns
   - Extensibility for new yaku definitions

5. **Game State Integration**
   - Interaction between scoring module and game state
   - Tracking partial yaku progress
   - Handling Koi-Koi decisions (continue vs take points)

Next Steps:

- Begin implementing the scoring module
- Start with base yaku definitions
- Implement core scoring logic
- Add game-specific variations
