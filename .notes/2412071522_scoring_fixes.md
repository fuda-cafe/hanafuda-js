# Scoring Module Fixes Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of changes made to fix failing tests in the scoring module, particularly around bright yaku handling and test assertions.

## Key Changes

### 1. AME_SHIKOU Pattern Refinement

The Rain-man Four (雨四光) yaku pattern was updated to be more explicit:

```javascript
pattern: {
  cards: [
    { id: "willow-rain-man" }, // Explicitly require Rain-man
    { type: CardType.BRIGHT, count: 3 }, // Plus any 3 other brights
  ]
}
```

This change ensures:

- Rain-man card is explicitly required
- Pattern is more precise than previous implementation
- Prevents ambiguity with regular SHIKOU pattern

### 2. Bright Checker Logic

The bright checker was simplified to handle Rain-man requirements more explicitly:

```javascript
if (yaku === SHIKOU) {
  effectiveCollection = createCollection({ cards: Array.from(collection) })
  effectiveCollection.remove(RAIN_MAN)
  console.debug("Removed Rain-man")
}
```

Benefits:

- Clear separation between SHIKOU and AME_SHIKOU checking
- Explicit handling of Rain-man card
- Maintains proper yaku precedence

### 3. Test Suite Updates

Tests were updated to verify the new behavior:

```javascript
// Test progression from SANKOU to AME_SHIKOU
collection.add(RAIN_MAN)
completed = checkBrightYaku(collection)
assertEquals(completed[0].name, "ame-shikou")
assertEquals(completed[0].points, 7)
```

Changes include:

- More explicit test cases for bright yaku progression
- Verification of Rain-man's effect on scoring
- Proper point value assertions

### 4. Debugging Improvements

Added strategic debug logging:

```javascript
console.debug(`Checking ${yaku.name} with ${collection.size()} cards`)
console.debug({ effectiveCollection: Array.from(effectiveCollection) })
```

Benefits:

- Better visibility into yaku checking process
- Easier troubleshooting of card collection state
- Clear tracking of Rain-man handling

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Hachi-Hachi Rules**: Some tests for Hachi-Hachi variant are currently ignored

   - May need further refinement of rule implementation
   - Particularly around Rain-man requirements

2. **Rule Configuration**: Potential need for more robust validation
   - Current implementation accepts all rule combinations
   - May need stricter validation for certain rule combinations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pattern Specificity**: Being explicit about card requirements in patterns helps prevent ambiguity

2. **Test Coverage**: Important to test both successful matches and edge cases, particularly around card type overlaps

3. **Debug Visibility**: Strategic logging helps identify issues in complex scoring logic

4. **Rule Variants**: Different rule variants may require more flexible pattern matching system

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix Hachi-Hachi rule implementation
2. Consider adding rule configuration validation
3. Add more edge case tests for bright yaku combinations
4. Document common debugging patterns for scoring issues
