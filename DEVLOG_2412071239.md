# Scoring Module Development Log

## Overview

The scoring module implements the yaku (役) scoring system for Hanafuda, with a focus on Koi-Koi rules. The implementation uses a declarative pattern system for yaku definitions and configurable rule checkers.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Declarative Pattern System

Chose a declarative approach over class-based implementation:

```javascript
// Declarative pattern example
const GOKOU = defineYaku({
  name: "gokou",
  description: ["Five Brights"],
  points: 15,
  pattern: {
    cards: [{ type: CardType.BRIGHT, count: 5 }],
  },
})
```

Benefits:

- Self-documenting yaku definitions
- Separation of pattern matching from scoring logic
- Easier testing and validation
- Better rule integration

### 2. Sake Cup Handling

Standardized sake cup handling across all checkers:

- Replaced enum-based approach with boolean flag
- Consistent `countSakeCup` configuration
- Proper point calculation in both modes

### 3. Rule Configuration

Implemented flexible rule system:

- Per-yaku type configuration
- Weather and seasonal effects for viewing yaku
- Multiple scoring options
- Extra point calculations

### 4. Scoring Manager

Created centralized scoring management:

- Handles both hand yaku and regular scoring
- Configurable rule sets for different variants
- Clear context handling (month, weather, etc.)

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Pattern System

- ✅ Yaku definition types
- ✅ Pattern matching utilities
- ✅ Base yaku factory function

### Phase 2: Standard Yaku

- ✅ Bright yaku (Five Brights, Four Brights, etc.)
- ✅ Animal yaku (Boar-Deer-Butterfly, Animals)
- ✅ Ribbon yaku (Poetry, Blue, Basic)
- ✅ Viewing yaku with weather/season rules
- ✅ Chaff yaku with extra points
- ✅ Month cards yaku
- ✅ Hand yaku (Teshi, Kuttsuki)

### Phase 3: Rule System

- ✅ Rule configuration types
- ✅ Rule checkers for each yaku type
- ✅ Weather and seasonal effects
- ✅ Multiple scoring options
- ✅ Extra point calculations

### Phase 4: Integration

- ✅ Scoring manager implementation
- ✅ Standard rule sets (Koi-Koi, Hachi-Hachi)
- ✅ Context handling
- ✅ Test coverage

## Fixed Issues

1. **Viewing Yaku Completion**

   - Fixed weather cancellation logic
   - Added proper point validation
   - Improved seasonal rule handling

2. **Sake Cup Handling**

   - Standardized approach across checkers
   - Fixed point calculation issues
   - Improved configuration clarity

3. **Hand Yaku Priority**
   - Fixed teyaku checking logic
   - Improved hand validation
   - Added proper context handling

## Current State

The scoring module is now complete with:

- Full implementation of all standard yaku
- Configurable rule system
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation

## Next Steps

While the core functionality is complete, potential future enhancements could include:

1. Additional game variants
2. Performance optimizations
3. Enhanced rule validation
4. Extended pattern matching capabilities
